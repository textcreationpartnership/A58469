            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Relation of what moſt Remarkably happen'd, during the laſt Campaign, in <hi>Ireland,</hi> betwixt His Majeſties Army Royal, and the Forces of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>AT a time when his Majeſties thoughts were wholly laid out and employ'd, chiefly to reinforce his Army, and repair thoſe loſſes which he ſuſtained by the Siege of <hi>London-Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and the unfortunate Defeat of his Forces at <hi>Cruon-Caſtle</hi> near <hi>Iniskilling,</hi> his Majeſty received certain Intelligence, That on the 12th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt, <hi>Monſieur de Schomberg</hi> with a Powerful Army, and a great Train of <hi>Artillery,</hi> ſufficiently provided with all <hi>Amunition,</hi> and Materials for War, did come to an Anchor in the Bay of <hi>Carick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fergus,</hi> in the <hi>North-Eaſt</hi> part of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that the Invaders the ſame day Landed 200 Men, who immediately Intrenched themſelves near the Sea-ſide to ſecure the Landing of the reſt.</p>
            <p>Brigadier <hi>Maxwell,</hi> Commander in Chief of his Majeſties Forces in thoſe <hi>Northern</hi> parts, finding himſelf too weak to make Oppoſition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſo Potent an Enemy, thought he was obliged in prudence, to retire back to the <hi>Newry,</hi> leaving only <hi>Macarty Moors</hi> Regiment of Foot, and nine Companies of <hi>Cormack O Neils</hi> in <hi>Carickfergus,</hi> to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Enemy, and hinder him, by the longeſt defence they could, from advancing too ſoon towards the King. The very next day <hi>Count de Schomberg</hi> Diſembarqued his whole Army without any oppoſition, and immediately Detached the 200 Men he ſet aſhore the day before, to <hi>Belfaſt</hi> (a ſmall open Town, ſcituated in the inmoſt part of that Bay) whither he preſently marched with his whole Army, and met
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:107163:3"/>there ready to joyn him, a conſiderable Reinforcement of Horſe from the Rebels of the <hi>North;</hi> he ſtayed at <hi>Belfaſt</hi> till the Nineteenth, and then ſent to Summons the Garriſon of <hi>Carickfergus</hi> to yield, which was Commanded by the ſaid Collonel <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>carty Moor,</hi> who ſlighted the Summons with that Reſolution and Bravery, as became a good Officer and a Loyal Subject.</p>
            <p>The next day being the 20th. of <hi>Auguſt, Count de Schomberg</hi> began to open his Trenches, and then played upon the Town from four Batteries of Cannon, and two Mortar-pieces; at the ſame time the Caſtle was furiouſly battered from the Fleet attending him in the Bay, ſo that in a ſhort ſpace both the Town and Caſtle were almoſt level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the Ground. However, the Governour bravely defended the place for Nine days, till he was reduced to the laſt Extremity, having but one Barrel of Powder left, and without any hope of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, he then quitted the Town upon very Honourable terms, tho' afterwards his Capitulation (almoſt in every Article) was moſt barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly broken by the <hi>Troops</hi> of <hi>Monſieur Schomberg,</hi> who ſuffered (in his own preſence) ſome of the Soldiers to be ſtripped of their Cloaths, Diſarmed, and otherwiſe baſely uſed, and he himſelf (directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Agreement) detained ſome Officers Priſoners.</p>
            <p>The Garriſon thus abuſed by the Rebels and their Adherents, march'd to the <hi>Newry,</hi> a little open Town, ſeated on the paſſage of the Mountains which divide the <hi>Northern</hi> Province of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> from that of <hi>Leinſter,</hi> in which is <hi>Dublin,</hi> the Metropolis of all the Kingdom. To this ſmall Town his Majeſty had ſent before his Grace the Duke of <hi>Berwick</hi> with a detachment of <hi>Horſe, Dragoons,</hi> and <hi>Foot,</hi> to divert the Enemies March, and hinder his too ſpeedy approaches, time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then very precious in reſpect to the circumſtances of his Majeſties Army; who on the 26th. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> leaving <hi>Dublin,</hi> came to <hi>Drogheda,</hi> attended with his <hi>Troop</hi> of Guards, and 200 Horſe of the Regiment of Collonel <hi>Parker,</hi> accompanied by <hi>Monſieur le Count D Avaux,</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador Extraordinary from his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, by Marqueſs <hi>De Roſen,</hi> Marſhal-General of the Armies of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and by many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Commanders and Officers of the Court, leaving the reſt of his Army Encamped near <hi>Dublin,</hi> to be put into a condition to follow his Majeſty, by the Care and Conduct of his Grace the Duke of <hi>Tyrconnel,</hi> (whoſe Zeal and Fidelity to the Crown in the worſt of Times, can hardly in Hiſtory find their Parallel) who in a ſhort time mannag'd
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107163:3"/>matters ſo well, that a conſiderable Army, well equipped and in good Order, marched after the King to <hi>Drogheda:</hi> where the Troops that daily arrived, Encamped on a riſing Ground, on the ſide of the Town next to <hi>Dublin,</hi> having the River and <hi>Drogheda</hi> before them, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Enemy, ſo that this place was conceived to be the moſt advantageous to Oppoſe him, in caſe of a ſpeedy March.</p>
            <p>His Grace the Duke of <hi>Berwick,</hi> one of his Majeſties Lieutenant-Generals, being at the <hi>Newry</hi> to obſerve the Motions of the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Enemy, had notice that <hi>Count Schomberg</hi> was coming forward with his whole Army, conſiſting of 22 Battalions of <hi>Foot,</hi> Six Regiments of <hi>Horſe,</hi> and Two of <hi>Dragoons,</hi> beſides the <hi>Iniskilling</hi> Band of Rebels, and that his Advance Guard was already in ſight; his Grace finding himſelf too weak to make any conſiderrable Oppoſition (after he had view'd an Advanced party conſiſting of Ten Squadrons of Horſe and obliged them to Retreat) Fired the Town, and to render the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Paſſage more difficult, broke up the High-ways, and made a good Retreat to <hi>Dundalk,</hi> a place ſcituated on this ſide the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, eight Miles from the <hi>Newry,</hi> and ſixteen from <hi>Drogheda.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Marqueſs <hi>D' Eſcots,</hi> who Commanded then in Chief at <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalk,</hi> upon conſideration with his Grace, that their United Forces could not maintain the Town, being an open place, and all its For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification Demoliſhed long ſince by <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> thought it beſt and moſt ſafe for the Kings Service, to preſerve their Men, and joyn the King, then Encamped with a good Army at <hi>Drogheda,</hi> which they did accordingly.</p>
            <p>About this time a <hi>Trumpet</hi> came from the Enemy to <hi>Drogheda,</hi> with a Letter directed to the Commander of <hi>Dundalk,</hi> in the Front of which, at firſt view, was repreſented a long Liſt of Titles, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Governour of the <hi>Ducal Pruſſia, Grandee</hi> of <hi>Portugal,</hi> Commander of ſeveral places, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the greateſt Titles were <hi>Duke de Schomberg,</hi> Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſſimo of the Armies of their Majeſties of <hi>Great-Brittain</hi> in <hi>England, Seotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland:</hi> after which, he ſeverely complains of the Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Newry,</hi> and grievouſly threatens Vengeance againſt the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners in his Cuſtody, if any further provocations in that kind ſhould be offered to him. To the haughty temper of which Letter, his Majeſty thought fit to return a ſuitable Anſwer, as from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Dundalk,</hi> in which he threatens <hi>Schomberg,</hi> That if ſpeedy reparation was not made for the Barbarous Uſage offered to the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107163:4"/>of <hi>Carickfergus;</hi> contrary almoſt to every Article of their Stipulation, he would take ſatisfaction for that breach of Faith, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Perſons of the Rebel Priſoners in his cuſtody; which Letter was thus directed.</p>

During all this time, his Majeſty prepared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with all diligence and expedition imaginable, to Rendezvous his Army at <hi>Drogheda,</hi> which was the better effected by the time the Enemy loſt in the Siege of <hi>Carickfergus,</hi> and by the ſlowneſs of <hi>Schombergs</hi> March through the difficult Paſſages of the Mountains, with his great Train of Artillery and Baggage, and through the deep Ways from thoſe Mountains to the <hi>Newry,</hi> which his Grace the Duke of <hi>Berwick</hi> had left very uneaſie to the Enemy, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt unpaſſable, by digging up and breaking all the Calce-ways thereabouts. By this time his Grace the Duke of <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> having ſetled all things in very good Order in <hi>Dublin,</hi> on the 12th. of <hi>September</hi> came to the King at <hi>Drogheda,</hi> with all the Horſe, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry

But what gave the King the greateſt ſatisfaction was, that he was ſure of his Army, not only as to their Fidelity, but alſo as to their Courage, by the impatience they expreſt in any delay, to Encounter the Enemy.</p>
            <p>By this time <hi>Count de Schomberg</hi> was advanced to <hi>Dundalk,</hi> upon which, his Majeſty reſolving to looſe no opportunity of Fighting the Enemy, and not any ways to baulk the vigorous reſolutions of his Soldiers, marched <hi>September</hi> the 14th. directly to <hi>Atherdee</hi> with the whole Army, in Order of Battel, upon two Columns (as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had directed it,) this place is half way betwixt <hi>Drogheda</hi> and <hi>Dundalk</hi>) the be ter there to obſerve the Enemies Countenance, where he thought fit to mark out his Camp, and ſent immediately Orders for the Foot to haſten their March, not judging it ſafe to be ſo near the Enemy without them: Upon which, the whole Brigade of his Majeſties Foot-Guard came up at Midnight, and the reſt of the Infantry joyned them the next day. The Army in its two Lines, with the Reſerve, Encamp'd in their Order of Battel upon the Hills fronting towards <hi>Dundalk,</hi> having the River of <hi>Largan</hi> before them, which had two Bridges oppoſite to each Wing of the firſt Line, <hi>Affain-Bridge</hi> at the Right, and <hi>Knockbridge</hi> at the Left, which were ſecured by Dragoons, tho' the River was paſſable in ſeveral places. His Majeſty contented himſelf with his Head Quarters in ſome very mean Cottages, at the right of the firſt Line, where his Bed-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber was a poor <hi>Iriſh Cabbin</hi> (hard to creep into) without either Door, Window, or Chimney; the <hi>French Ambaſſador,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Tyrconnel,</hi> had ſuitable Apartments in his Majeſties Quarters, and the other General Officers were Accomodated after the ſame faſhion in their reſpective Poſts.</p>
            <p>All the Ground from the River <hi>Largan</hi> towards <hi>Dundalk,</hi> is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Riſe of Hills, until you come to a Valley, in which there is a Narrow Bogg, which beginning from the left, runs the whole length of the Town, and ſo continues to the Sea-ſide. His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:107163:5"/>Advanced Guards on the Top of theſe Hills, ſtood conſtantly in View of the Town, and of thoſe of the Enemy, ſeperated only by this Bogg, through which there were ſeveral narrow Paſſes or Defiles.</p>
            <p>The King went every day on Horſe-back to view and obſerve the Enemies Poſtures; there did not happen many Skirmiſhes between both Armies, but upon all occaſions that any of the Kings Party had to paſs the Bogg, or to Charge the Enemy, they had ever the better of it, taking ſeveral Priſoners, either Forraging or in other Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances: And many Deſerters from <hi>Schombergs</hi> Army came over to the Kings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Count Schomberg</hi> had diſpoſed his Camp upon two Lines in the plain Ground, at the Foot of the Hills which were <hi>Northward</hi> of <hi>Dundalk,</hi> having the River before him, and the Town behind it; where he had taken up his own Quarters, with ſome Horſe and Foot of his own, and of the <hi>Iniskilling</hi> Rebels, who had joyned his Army: His Left Wing was ſecured by a large Arm of the Sea, which came up to the Town, by which his Ships brought him from the <hi>North</hi> of this Kingdom, and from <hi>England,</hi> all Proviſions of <hi>Bisket, Beer,</hi> &amp;c. and Forrage for his Horſes: To ſecure his Right Wing, which lay moſt Expoſed, he made ſome Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and put a ſtrong Garriſon into a Caſtle of my Lord <hi>Bellew,</hi> ſcituated upon a Riſing Ground; for his greater ſafety, he Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied all the Avenues to <hi>Dundalk,</hi> with ſtrong Retrenchments, to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend which, he there Poſted a Battalion of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Guards, and a Regiment of <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Four days after his Majeſty had Encamped at <hi>Alers-Town,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to obſerve <hi>Count Schomberg</hi>'s Countenance a little cloſer, and endeavour to Engage him to a Battel. Upon this Deſign the <hi>King</hi> Marched with his whole Army towards him in excellent Order. His Grace the Duke of <hi>Tyrconnel,</hi> Captain-General, Commanded the Right Wing; the Marqueſs <hi>de Roſen,</hi> Marſhal of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Left. The <hi>King</hi> himſelf drew up his Army in full view of the Enemy, ſo that the Extent of the Right Wing of the firſt Line, was within leſs than Cannon-Shot of them: Both Lines being rang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed along the Hills, extending to the Left, a little more remote from the Enemy, whoſe Advanced Guards from their Poſts, did plainly ſee the Diſpoſition and excellent Order of the <hi>Royal Army.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:107163:5"/>
The Day was very clear, ſo that the brightneſs of the Arms, with the glittering reflections from the broad Syths, (which moſt of the Foot were Armed with Inſtead of Pikes) ſeem'd to ſtrike ſome Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror into the Enemies Army.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty, attended by <hi>Count d' Avaux</hi> and ſome Perſons of Quality of his Court, was upon the Deſeent of the Hill, nearer ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced towards the Enemy than the Right Wing: A Squadron of about 60 Voluntiers (being for the moſt part Officers of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Houſhold) were upon a lower Ground, and ſomewhat nearer to the Enemy, at the very Entrance of the Paſs towards the Bogg, which Party was Commanded by the Right Honourable my Lord <hi>Hunſdon,</hi> and ſome other Reformed Officers of Note: My Lord <hi>Thomas Howard</hi> Riding Right-hand-Man of the firſt Rank, and Marched directly up to the very Entrance of this Paſſage (which leads through the Bogg to <hi>Dundalk;</hi>) to ſecure which, the Enemy at the Mouth thereof, had ſtrongly Entrenched themſelves with a party of Dragoons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Schomberg</hi> conceiving his Majeſty intended to force his Paſs, and ſo to enter <hi>Dundalk,</hi> Commanded his <hi>Iniskilling</hi> Foot to Advance to the Entrance of it towards the Town, and ſupported them with a Squadron of Horſe, and ſtrongly Lined all the Entrenchments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them towards the Town, with Muſqueteers.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty obſerving theſe Motions of the Enemy, Poſted ſome Dragoons on each ſide this Paſs, further Advanced beyond the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntiers, to Flank the Enemy in caſe they ſhould attempt to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance; and ſome Foot-Granadeers ware advantagiouſly put into ſeveral little Cabbins at the winding of this way, not a Muſquet-ſhot from the Enemy, who ſtood at the Head of the Defiles. Here hapned ſome little Skirmiſhes, but no conſiderable loſs to either ſide. And after that his Majeſties Army had been thus drawn up for three hours in view of the Enemy; during which time ſeveral Acclamations and Shouts Ecchoed from them, as Men full of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Reſolution to Fight; nothing of which could provoke the Enemy from their Holes, nor was any thing elſe attempted by them. His Majeſty Commanded the Army to March back to <hi>Alers-Town,</hi> the left Wing of each Line being then the Van-Guard, the the King himſelf remaining in the Rear of his whole Army, there expecting the Enemy would Detach ſome ſtrong Party to obſerve his March, but not a Man of them ſtirred.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:107163:6"/>
No ſooner was <hi>Count Schomberg</hi> come into <hi>Ireland,</hi> but he preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſound he had great reaſon to ſuſpect the <hi>French</hi> Troops, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thoſe who were newly raiſed, and had Deſerted in <hi>Flanders,</hi> as well as the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and moſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> which he brought over with him, and this could not well be prevented; for the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> being extreamly put to it for want of Men to Invade <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> was forced to Inliſt every body he could get, without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Examination, having even admitted without any Diſtinction, all the <hi>French</hi> Deſerters which his Adherent had ſent him from the Low Countreys. But what increaſed the Doubt and Jealouſies of this Old General, was the Proclamation ſet out by his Majeſty, and the Conditions he therein offered to ſuch as were his own-Subjects, and thoſe that were Forreigners, in caſe they would De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert the Enemy, and embrace the Juſtice of his Quarrel againſt them. And alſo the Declaration of his Excellency the <hi>Count d' Avaux,</hi> purſuant to the Pardon Granted by his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, to ſuch of his Subjects that had Deſerted his Service, and were then in <hi>Schomberg</hi>'s Army, in caſe they would forſake it, and Inliſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Service of his Majeſty of <hi>Great-Brittain.</hi> Reflecting on theſe things, with the ſeveral Notes diſperſed to the purpoſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of through his Camp, he thought himſelf obliged more to Guard himſelf againſt the growing Dangers in his own Army, than to think of advancing any further againſt the Kings. He preſently enjoyned every body, upon pain of Death, not to ſtir out of his Camp. The Provoſt-Marſhal was always abroad, and he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a Reward of five Piſtols for every Deſerter that ſhould be brought to him; and to ſtrike a terror into every body, he cauſed ſeveral to be Hanged upon a bare ſuſpicion that they intended to Deſert. Diſtruſting 500 <hi>French,</hi> he Diſarmed and ſtripped them of their Cloaths, all in one day, and preſently Shipp'd them back for <hi>England,</hi> from thence (as credibly reported) to be ſent into the Iſlands of <hi>America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding all this ſeverity, Deſerters came daily to the King, who from time to time gave an account of the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Sick, and the mighty ſcarcity of <hi>Schomberg</hi>'s Camp, tho' ſupplyed with all Neceſſaries by his Shipping, as much as they could poſſibly bring him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:107163:6"/>
His Majeſty having Notice of theſe advantages againſt the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, reſolved to reduce them to greater ſtraights, by deſtroying all the Forrage they had yet left before their Camp, and along the Sea-Coaſt: To effect which, he Detached a conſiderable Body of Horſe and Foot to defend another Party that were ſent to bring with them all the Forrage they could carry, and then in ſight of <hi>Dundalk,</hi> they Burnt all that was left for four Miles together, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt oppoſition of the Enemy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Count Schomberg</hi> ſuffering all theſe things, made us eaſily believe, he with his Army was but in a bad Condition, and not able to undertake any conſiderable Action; and to prevent the Danger of a panick fear in his Army, he amuſed them with the Expectations of 10000 <hi>Danes,</hi> which he expected daily, and deluded them with falſe News of great Defeats, which the Rebels (his Adherents) had given his Majeſties Forces in other parts of the Kingdom; and cauſed them to make publick Demonſtrations of Joy for thoſe Fancied Victories. It would have been a Miſtory to the King's Party even to this minute, had we not been informed by ſeveral Deſerters, why he cauſed three Volleys of ſmall Shot, and three Peals of his Cannon, both from the Ships, and from the Shoar, which they ſay was for Joy of a Great Victory obtained by the Rebels againſt the King at <hi>Connaught,</hi> that his Majeſty could never hear of to this day. Sometimes he kept up their drooping Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits by giving out, that <hi>Dublin</hi> would be ſuddenly ſurpriſed by ſome Troops that he had ſent thither for that purpoſe by Sea, which were actually Landed there, and that all the Inhabitants of that great City, had joyned his Party, and Declared themſelves for him. 'Tis true that their Ships came to an Anchor in <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>-Road, and that they began to Land ſome Men, when many Perſons of Quality (as Voluntiers) with the Militia of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, both Horſe and Foot, Marched in good Order to the Sea-ſide, to oppoſe their Deſign, (being Conducted by the Right Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable the Lords High-Chancellor, and Chief Juſtice of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom) who ſoon obliged them to retire to their Ships, which then immediately put to Sea; and that City was ſo well managed, that it remained ſtill in perfect Peace, by the great Care and Conduct of the Honourable <hi>Simon Luttrell,</hi> Collonel of Dragoons, and Governour of the Place, where by his Prudence he had ſo
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:107163:7"/>well ordered every thing, that no attempts from abroad, or from any Faction within the City, could produce any Miſchief, or give the Enemy any advantage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charlemont</hi> being the only place in the <hi>North</hi> of any ſtrength remaining in his Majeſties poſſeſſion, the King believing the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my might be conſiderably annoyed by Excurſions from thence, if they had a Garriſon ſufficient for that purpoſe, ſent thither a Detachment of Foot, and ſo ſoon as they arrived Major <hi>Regan,</hi> Governour of that Important place, ſent a ſtrong Party imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately and took <hi>Dunganron,</hi> where he made a conſiderable Booty from the Enemy: And further to reinforce this Garriſon, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Detachment of Foot was ſent them, not only to defend the place againſt the Enemy, but alſo to enable them to diſturb and annoy the Rebels as much as poſſible, during the Seaſon of the Winter.</p>
            <p>Before <hi>Schomberg</hi> made his deſcent into <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Town and Caſtle of <hi>Sligo</hi> were poſſeſſed by the Rebels of <hi>Iniskilling;</hi> tho' the Town is an open place, yet the Caſtle is very ſtrong, and is the chief inlet from the <hi>North,</hi> into the Province of <hi>Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aught,</hi> in the <hi>Weſt</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> from whence they made frequent Incurſions into that Province, and put the ſtrong Town of <hi>Galway</hi> it ſelf into great apprehenſions of Danger, particularly from the notice of ſome private Intelligence held betwixt Collonel <hi>Ruſſel</hi> and the diſaffected party of that Town, of which he had been formerly Governour, and was now joyned with the Enemy.</p>
            <p>The King receiving certain Advice, that <hi>Count Schomberg</hi> was about ſending ſome <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Granadiers, with other Troops, to carry on the Deſigns of the Rebels of <hi>Sligo,</hi> gave Orders immediately for Brigadier <hi>Sarsfield,</hi> with the Regiment of Houſe Commanded by Collonel <hi>Henry Luttrel,</hi> Sir <hi>Neile O' Neile</hi>'s Regiment of Dragoons, and the three Regiments of Foot of <hi>Charles O Bryan, Moor,</hi> and <hi>Obara,</hi> to March forthwith to <hi>Sligo,</hi> and to clear that Province wholly of the Rebels: The ſaid Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadier (whoſe Loyalty and Courage had already rendered him ſuſticiently terrible to the Enemies of the Crown) being come to <hi>Athlone,</hi> Detached ſeveral Parties to poſſeſs the Paſſes, one of which meeting a Party of the Enemy, gave them an entire De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat, and reprized a great number of black Cattel: Another of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:107163:7"/>his Parties joyning with ſome of the Militia, and ſome Gentlémen Volunteirs of the Countrey, took a place called <hi>James-Town,</hi> and put, all the Garriſon there to a ſhameful flight, which they ſo cloſely purſued, that they were forced (to ſecure themſelves) to Swim three Rivers, where many of them were Drowned, and the reſt totally diſperſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sarfield</hi> now Advancing into the Province of <hi>Connaught,</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached Collonel <hi>Henry Luttrel</hi> with a conſiderable Party, to hinder the Forces ſent by <hi>Schomberg,</hi> from coming to <hi>Sligo,</hi> but a Body of Rebels iſſuing out of the Town to ſuſtain the Enemy, <hi>Luttrel</hi> found himſelf as it were ſhut in betwixt them both, having only his Party of Horſe and Dragoons with him, the Foot being not yet come up, by reaſon of the difficulty of their March; at which ſurprize, this brave Commander no whit diſmayed, but he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently divided his Men into two Parties, and Commanded them to face both ways to the Enemy, which they did, and Charged them ſo vigorouſly, that they Routed them intirely, and purſued them to the very Gates of <hi>Sligo,</hi> where by freſh ſupplys, they were enabled to make Oppoſition; but Brigadier <hi>Sarsfield</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing immediately after, the Rebels abandoned the Town, ſave only about 500, which retired into the Caſtle, which was preſently In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted, and ſoon after formally Beſieged. They defended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for four days after the opening the Trenches, but then thinking an early Capitulation beſt, they obtained good Terms; after which they Marched away, only ſome <hi>French</hi> Granadiers took Party with his Majeſties Forces. The taking of this place was of great Importance to the <hi>King,</hi> the Enemy by this being wholly ſhut up into the Ruined Countrey of the <hi>North,</hi> where they muſt certainly be reduced to great Extremities. This ſucceſs was ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by another no leſs beneficial to his Majeſties Affairs, which was the taking of a Caſtle poſſeſſed by the Rebels, ſcituated on a moſt conſiderable Paſs into the ſame Province: At the firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the <hi>King</hi>'s Forces, the Enemy deſired to Capitulate, though it was otherwiſe impoſſible to take it, without Cannon, if they had been endued with Courage to make any Reſiſtance. Forrage now growing ſcarce about <hi>Alers-Town,</hi> nothing almoſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining betwixt <hi>Dundalk</hi> and <hi>Aberdee,</hi> and the Enemy being in no Condition likely to make any Attempt, his Majeſty (the 15th.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:107163:8"/>of <hi>October</hi>) thought fit to break up his Camp, and March back to <hi>Atherdee,</hi> where the Infantry Encamped on two Lines, having the Town behind them, from the Enemy; the Horſe were divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſeveral Quarters thereabouts, for their better Accomodation, they beginning to ſuffer by the badneſs of the Seaſon, and alſo for want of Forrage. The <hi>King</hi> reſolving to Fortiſie <hi>Atherdee,</hi> the Fortifications were begun before his Majeſty came thither, and were afterwards carried on with all poſſible diligence during one whole Month whilſt he ſtayed there, all which time the Enemy attempted nothing, but upon Parties the <hi>King</hi> ſent out, there was ſome of them killed, and ſeveral taken Priſoners; and ſuch as fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Deſerted <hi>Schombergs</hi> Camp, brought conſtant Tydings of their great Sickneſs, and general want of almoſt all Neceſſaries for Humane ſupport.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Atherdee</hi> being now ſufficiently capable to defend it ſelf, and continual Rains growing very troubleſome, his Majeſty diſpoſed his Army into Winter Quarters, he himſelf returning to <hi>Drogheda,</hi> (upon the 13th. of <hi>November</hi>) where he made a ſtay only of five days; and to preſerve the Forrage there, came the 18th. of the ſame Month to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and ſoon after received Intelligence, that <hi>Schomberg</hi> not being able to ſtay any longer at <hi>Dundalk,</hi> had left that place, and in it many of his Sick Men behind. <hi>Monſieur de Boiſsleau,</hi> Major-General and Governour of <hi>Atherdee,</hi> having the firſt notice of it, ſent a Party of 24 Horſe thither; the Officer who Commanded having found no body in the Town, ſent 12 of his Party after the Enemy, to take an account of them, three Miles beyond the Town; towards the Mountains they overtook ſome of the Enemies Baggage, Guarded by 100 Foot, whom they Charged and put to flight, made two Officers Priſoners, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Soldiers, and made a conſiderable Booty.</p>
            <p>The Mighty Expectations of the Great <hi>Schomberg,</hi> and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Adherents, being thus Defeated, he Marched into the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> towards <hi>Belfaſt,</hi> with the week remainder of his Army, being diminiſht much above one half, by extream Sickneſs, and want of neceſſary Subſiſtance, tho' he had a Fleet to attend him, and a whole Province behind him.</p>
            <p>The Succeſs of this Campaign has no ways been anſwerable to what <hi>Count Schomberg</hi> (had with the greateſt aſſurances) propoſed
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:107163:8"/>to himſelf, but much contrary to the hopes he had given to his Troops of Quartering in <hi>Dublin,</hi> and to divide amongſt them as <hi>Cromwel</hi> had done, the Poſſeſſions and Inheritances of the Loyal Party; he not doubting in the leaſt, with the Army he had brought, and with the help of the Rebels, to be a compleat Conqueror of the whole Kingdom before the end of the Campaign; otherwiſe, a General of his Character, would never have attempted a Deſign ſo great and Hazardous, to the loſs of that Honour and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which he had been ſo many years acquiring.</p>
            <p>And to add full Meaſure of Grief to the Retirement of this General, amidſt all the Fruſtrations of his Deſigns, my Lord <hi>Mountcaſhel</hi> moſt ingeniouſly wrought his own Deliverance from his Conſinement at <hi>Iniskilling,</hi> being pretty well recovered of his Wounds, and came to the <hi>King</hi> at the Caſtle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Officers and others, from the Enemy, on <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 17th. of <hi>December,</hi> where his Lordſhip was very kindly received by the <hi>King</hi> with a Hearty Welcome, and Carreſſed by all the Great Officers and others his Friends, with all demonſtrations of Joy and Gladneſs imaginable.</p>
